This little script finds all the audio elements of a page. For each  element, adds accessible controls above it, in order to   manipulate the player.
The script requires Jquery 1.7 or above. Jquery 2.1.4 is included.
The script is currently in Spanish and in an bad english , so translations and corrections are greatly apreciated ;)

For translations, I'm using the tools from: http://www.localeplanet.com
If you want to collaborate in translation or improving the player, feel free to do it by using the github repository: https://github.com/kastwey/html5-accessible-audio-player

Enjoy it!
